# Amazon Sales EDA

This project is all about digging into some Amazon sales data and making sense of it through solid exploratory data analysis. I used Python and a bunch of its data tools (mainly pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn) to clean the data, explore what’s going on, and highlight the most interesting parts.

## So What Did I Actually Do?

First, I cleaned the raw data, there were some missing values, inconsistent formats, and a few things that needed fixing to make the analysis smoother.

After that, I started breaking down the data:

- Looked at which product categories were getting the most attention.
- Analyzed sales across different marketplaces to see if any stood out.
- Checked out seller performance and ranked the **top 3 sellers** in each category, focusing specifically on **January**.
- Used visualizations to bring the numbers to life and make the insights easier to spot.

## What’s Interesting Here?

- Some product categories clearly dominate the sales, no surprise, but it’s good to see it in the data.
- A few sellers really outperformed the rest in their categories.
- There are patterns depending on the marketplace and time period that could help businesses make smarter decisions.

This project was a great chance to apply EDA skills on something practical. If you're into data analysis or just curious about e-commerce trends, you'll probably find something interesting here.
## Why This Project Matters?

E-commerce platforms like Amazon generate a massive amount of transactional data. Being able to extract useful insights from such data is a key skill in data analysis and business intelligence. This project is a hands-on example of applying those skills on real-world-like data.
